# Dignans Project

## Overview

This project is a coursework assignment focused on creating a [website for **Dignans**](https://stan-dignans.netlify.app/), a fictional high-quality outdoor catering company based in Edinburgh. The website is designed to promote the company's services, attract new customers, and simplify the ordering process. The theme revolves around catering for local businesses, event planners, and corporate clients in Edinburgh.

## Key Details  
- **Technology Stack**: The implementation uses **only HTML and CSS**, with no scripts or frameworks.  
- **Functionality**: The site includes basic navigation between pages and form field validation, but no advanced features.  
- **Design Compliance**: The website strictly follows the specifications outlined in the [Website Design and Development Report](https://github.com/StanStarishko/Dignans/blob/main/docs/Website%20Design%20and%20Development%20Report.pdf).  

## Challenge and Approach  
To add complexity to this simple project, I opted to create custom styles mimicking **Bootstrap's functionality**. This decision introduced **"dead code" (redundant features)** in the stylesheets, intentionally making the task more challenging. The goal was to build a reusable custom "framework" for future projects with similar restrictions on libraries and frameworks.  

## Purpose  
The project serves as a foundational exercise in HTML/CSS, emphasizing design consistency, accessibility, and responsive layouts while adhering to strict technical constraints.
